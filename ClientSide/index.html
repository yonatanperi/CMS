            This is a CMS panel with 2 pages - country management list, and a map.<br>
            The first page is the countries management page.
            You can find there a table with a list of countries and their info and two buttons.
            The edit button will pop a dialog with a form to edit the country information: Name, country code, lat/long, description.
            The delete button will delete the country from db.<br>
            The second page is World Map. The page display a map of the world, and markers for each country.
            When clicking on a marker, display an info window with the country information.<br>
            I have worked very hard on this website and I managed to build it in less than 48 hours using Node.js as requested.
            You can use the side-bar on the left to visit the different pages.
